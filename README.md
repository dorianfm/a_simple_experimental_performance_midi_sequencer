# A Simple? Experimental Performance (MIDI) Sequencer

This is inspired by sequencing in [Eurorack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurorack), and my fondness of the [Becafaco Muxlicer](https://www.befaco.org/muxlicer-2/) for creating quick and simple sequences. I wanted to create something which was similar, but allowed for more complexity of both rhythm and experssion, as well as beign quite playable in it's own right, and being able to add complexity in the length of sequnces, as well as being easily playable and adaptable in real time. 

I've tried to take parts of eurorack sequencers, trackers and more traditional sequencers and munged them together into a javascript bastardisation of a sequencer. It doesn't even do timing properly at this point as it uses the notoriously unreliable setTimeout to set the times between notes, so the measures are imprecise. Howevert this imprecision is partially what I'm lookinf for, something a bit looser - it feels 'close enough for jazz' for my liking at this time, balancing trying out the experiment vs over-enginering a solution.

This is very much a work in progress and I'm adapting it and changing it and pushing changes as and when I feel fit and have the energy to experiment.
